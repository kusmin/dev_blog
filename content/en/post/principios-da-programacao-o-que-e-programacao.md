It may seem trivial, but starting with the concepts of what a certain thing does or is, helps us develop better in that area of interest. Today I will start a series that is essentially about these concepts, almost as if it were our old and forgotten dictionary (today google does this job for us :)).

And to start nothing better than talking about what programming is, both in theory and in practice. Many people say, "I want to be a programmer", "How do I become a programmer". But that's where the detail is, what is programming? What does a programmer do ?

##### What is programming

When you wake up in the morning, many times we meet other people, we greet, say good morning, talk, ask how things are going, or sometimes we just nod our heads in greeting or many times not even that, even not communicating verbally, our actions and bodies communicate. Every action that we do or do not do communicates something to someone or something, we are intrinsically social beings. As much as we may say that I am anti-social (I say this myself a lot!), the truth is that communication is the basis of our society.

And in this case when we talk about programming, we are talking about a form of communication between man-machine, creator-creation. In this case we have a serious problem that one does not understand the other, man speaks through letters and words, a machine can understand zeros and ones. So that we can talk and interact with the machine we need an interpreter, who can make the translation from one side to the other, for this we have the Programming Languages, which have this role to guarantee an efficient communication between man and machine.

Through this interaction, we can create sites, applications, data processing and several other tools that help us in our day-to-day life.

This is an initial concept of what programming is, there are many other concepts behind it that don't make much sense to approach at this moment, but that we will refine as this series goes on.

And now, where does the programmer come into all this?

##### What does the programmer do?

The programmer, again an initial concept, is responsible for writing instructions in a programming language for the machine to perform some action.

He has as his main tool the programming language, he is above all a linguist who passes the instructions from the human form to the programming language. He makes between meat and silicon(that was a bit of a dramatic statement).

He has the role of making sure that what is being asked for in human language, is transported into computer language ensuring the minimum possible loss in this communication. Here enters a very important detail before starting to write the code for the machine, the programmer must understand very well what must be done (most of the programming errors happen here, when the communication between client-programmer is not well done). And more than just creating, he must guarantee that the program keeps running over time, guaranteeing not only its creation, but its maintenance and evolution.

##### Conclusion

In this article, we have put some initial concepts that anyone who is wanting to get into the world of programming should try to know, so that they can better understand where they are going and what they should do to get in on the right foot. In the next posts we will see some more concepts and delve deeper into what programming is. Until next time!
