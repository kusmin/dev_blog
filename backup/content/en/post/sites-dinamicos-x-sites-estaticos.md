The incredible amount of groups is divided:- The values ​​of this amount are large.

## What is the difference between interesting sites and sites

<br>

Basically the shape names are self-explanatory, static sites, they don't change much, have no or little interaction, in essence HTML and CSS, they are cheaper sites to be, they don't require and simpler to make great complexity.

<br><br>

Sites that use users demand the user, have the greatest interaction with the user of the user, generally use some scripting language (php ruby, java, java, etc.), they are sites with greater complexity, of some database.

<br>

### When to use each

<br>

static sites should be used for simpler sites, such as blogs, documentation, newsletters. Sites made of more text and images. Nowadays we have good options for building static sites, such as Jekyll (in which this blog is made and I will talk about it in another post), HUGO, next.js, among others. In addition to good CMS options such as forestry.io.

<br>

More sites should be done when interacting with the user and using as an example database, need a content management system. They are more expensive to produce at the beginning, but they can be better designed and more interactive.

<br>

One or the other depends on the needs of each situation and should be a very practical choice and more to take account of each type of situation.
