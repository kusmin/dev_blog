In the first post, we talked a bit about what programming is and what a programmer does [http://updevblog.com/pt/post/principios-da-programacao-o-que-e-programacao/](http://updevblog.com/pt/post/principios-da-programacao-o-que-e-programacao/ "http://updevblog.com/pt/post/principios-da-programacao-o-que-e-programacao/") . We mentioned briefly about programming languages and their important role in man-machine communication, let's go deeper in this post about programming languages.

#### What is a programming language?

A programming language as said before is a form of communication between programmer and machine, it is through it that we tell the machine how to act and what should be done. As it is a language by nature it has a _standardized_ method with _syntactic_ and _semantic_ rules. In other words, a programmer is first of all a linguist, a specialist in that he is dedicated to the study and teaching of languages.

Like a writer or copywriter, the greater the mastery the programmer has over the language he is writing in, the more sophisticated, readable and understandable is the code he writes. Readability and ease of understanding is fundamental, so that other programmers and people can understand your code. 

A high readability of code allows a lay person in programming to understand what that code does, even without understanding the language, from the see the importance of assigning meaningful names to our variables, functions and classes.

A well written code (algorithm) is like writing a book, it makes an introduction (what the code does), introduces the characters (variables and classes) and enters the climax (usually the reason for the program's existence, with its domain and business rule). It is possible to create in the right context best-selling and true literary works.

#### High-level and low-level languages

The closer the programming language is to human language, the higher level is the easier it is to learn and use because it is already familiar to us, so the learning curve is lower (dramatically increases productivity) than the low level programming languages that are closer to machine language with its zeros and ones.

A high-level language is more abstract, allowing the programmer to tell the machine what to do without often having to worry about machine-specific details like memory allocation or the operating system. It creates less dependency between specific machines and computer environments, thus ensuring greater flexibility and portability. As a programmer and writer it is your obligation to ensure that your code is as flexible and portable as possible.

#### What does the machine do with my code?

After writing your code in a programming language (usually high-level), there will be an intermediate phase in which your code will be _compiled_ or _interpreted,_ into a language that the computer can understand and perform the actions and instructions described in your code.

We will not focus at this point on how this is done, only that there is a compiler or interpreter that will translate your code.

#### A little history

##### Taken from wikipedia

The first programming language work was created by [Ada Lovelace](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace "Ada Lovelace"), a close friend of [Charles Babbage](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage "Charles Babbage"). The project of the first programmable mechanical calculator was conceived by [Charles Babbage](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage "Charles Babbage"), who, after spending a fortune and a long time, could not realize the project. The programming language [ADA](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(program_language%C3%A7%C3%A3o) "Ada (programming language)") was named after this first programmer.

One of the first programming languages for computers was probably [Plankalkül](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plankalk%C3%BCl "Plankalkül"), created by [Konrad Zuse](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konrad_Zuse "Konrad Zuse") in [Nazi Germany](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alemanha_Nazista "Nazi Germany"), but which had little or no impact on the future of programming languages.

The first compiler was written by [Grace Hopper](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper "Grace Hopper") in 1952 for the [A-0](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistema_A-0 "A-0 System") programming language.[\[14\]](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguagem_de_programa%C3%A7%C3%A3o#cite_note-wexel-15) The first widely used high-level programming language was [Fortran](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran "Fortran"), created in 1954. In 1957, [B-0](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-0 "B-0") was created, a successor to A-0, which would give rise to [Flow-Matic](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-Matic "Flow-Matic") (1958), the immediate predecessor of [COBOL](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL "COBOL"), from 1959. COBOL was a widely accepted language for commercial use. The [ALGOL](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALGOL "ALGOL") language was created in 1958-1960 ALGOL-60 had a major influence on the design of many later languages.

The [Lisp](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp "Lisp") language was created in [1958](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/1958 "1958") and became widely used in research in the field of [computer science](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ci%C3%AAncia_da_computa%C3%A7%C3%A3o "Computer Science") most prominently in the field of [Artificial Intelligence](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelig%C3%AAncia_Artificial "Artificial Intelligence"). Another language related to the field of AI that appears in 1972 is [Prolog](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog "Prolog"), a language of the logic paradigm.

Object orientation](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orienta%C3%A7%C3%A3o_a_objetos "Object Orientation") is another important milestone in the history of programming languages. The [Simula 67](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simula_67 "Simula 67") language introduces the concept of classes.The [Smalltalk](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk "Smalltalk") language expands the concept of classes and becomes the first programming language that offered complete support for object-oriented programming. The [C++] language (https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B "C++") (originally known as C with classes) popularizes object-orientation.

Several programming languages have emerged since then. These include [C#](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp "C Sharp"), [VB.NET](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/VB.NET "VB.NET"), [Java](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguagem_de_programa%C3%A7%C3%A3o_Java "Java programming language"), [Object Pascal](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Pascal "Object Pascal"), [Objective-C](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C "Objective-C"), [PHP](https://pt. wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP "PHP"), [Python](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python "Python"), [SuperCollider](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperCollider "SuperCollider"), [D language](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_(programming_language%C3%A7%C3%A3o) "D (programming language)"), and [Ruby](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language%C3%A7%C3%A3o) "Ruby (programming language)").

#### Conclusion

In this post we have seen a little bit about what programming languages are, and how they are aligned with the programmer's daily work. How a greater knowledge of the language allows you to create code of higher quality and readability.

I hope this article influences you to study and deepen your knowledge in the IT area! Until next time, folks!
